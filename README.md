For this project I made use of the Unsplash API for Developers. The API gives access to the world largest open collection of high quality photos, totally free. With using different querys, like searching, popular, etc etc, the user can receive a lot of information about the image. All the available information contains:

### Used endpoints

To make use of my application I've used two differend

- `https://api.unsplash.com/photos/?client_id=${API_KEY}&per_page=33&order_by=popular`
- `https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos/?client_id=${API_KEY}&query=${SEARCH_QUERY}&per_page=33&order_by=popular `
- `https://api.unsplash.com/photos/1gLdTsX3_70?client_id=${API_KEY}`

### API Response

After requesting the API you will receive an object with a lot of information about the photos. Below is described what all information means.
